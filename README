This is an update to nttcp for Linux.  For information on nttcp and
ttcp, see http://sd.wareonearth.com/~phil/net/ttcp/.  The version of
nttcp included is based on
http://sd.wareonearth.com/~phil/net/ttcp/nttcp.c.

The main changes are:

  1) We have modernized and cleaned-up the C usage to the point that
  it compiles without warning under gcc 4.4.4.

  2) We have added a handler for SIGUSR1 which prints the struct
  tcp_info statistics (see /usr/include/linux/tcp.h, net/ipv4/tcp.c)
  for the socket to standard error.

  3) We have added a handler for SIGUSR2 which prints the I/O
  stattistics to standard error (a la dd).

Both signal handlers are setup so that sending or receiving should
resume after the handler returns, and we have inserted a few checks
for interrupted system calls, but it may still induce some flakiness.
